# Driving Test
This is a program to help people practice for the Learner's Test in India.

## What? 
Yeah. That's right. I decided to make this because I didn't want to stare at a janky pdf for a good 2 days. 
So, I decided to learn how to parse and extract data from a PDF using a smorgasbord of Python libraries. 

## Most of the codebase seems to be complete from your initial commit. Why commit now?
I wanted to just upload this once I was done, but I wanted to store a previous commit as I play around with OOP and encapsulation for the data extraction script. 
This is a big design change because I've been quite averse to OOP for the longest time (especially since I was introduced to the simplicity of C).
In case this all goes awry, I have my initial commit as a backup.

## Things I aim to learn from this
- The "joy" of data extraction (quotes for sarcasm)
- How to make my own project
- Event driven programming with `tkinter`
- There's something I'm missing here that I should add later...

## Hmm. Interesting. How do I run this?
It's not complete. Don't even try to run it. Hopefully I'll be able to make it into an executable.

## Credit where credit's due
If you want to know where I copied code snippets from and don't want to read the code, here you go:
